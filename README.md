 # Neural Network with Four Hidden Layers in C++

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a deep neural network with four hidden layers. The network is designed for multi-class classification tasks and is trained using backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent.

## Key Features:

  Four Hidden Layers: The network architecture includes four hidden layers with configurable neuron counts.
  
  Softmax Activation: Softmax activation function is used in the output layer for multi-class classification.
  
  Backpropagation: Implements the backpropagation algorithm for efficient weight updates.
  
  Random Weight Initialization: Weights are initialized using a normal distribution to break symmetry and speed up convergence.
  
  Training and Prediction: Provides methods for training the network on input data with corresponding labels, and making predictions on new data.
